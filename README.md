# Minimum Distance between Superquadrics

## Project Description

This project focuses on calculating the minimum distance between superquadrics using a closed-form Minkowski sum approach.

## Installation Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `math`
- `mpl_toolkits`

## Function Descriptions

- **demo_minimum_distance.py**: The main program for executing the distance calculation.
- **minkowski_sum_definition.py**: Defines the closed-form Minkowski sum for superquadrics.
- **function.py**: Includes utility functions for converting angles from degrees to radians and adding coordinate axes.

## Usage Instructions

To use the project, run the main program:

> python demo_minimum_distance.py
